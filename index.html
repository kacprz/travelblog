	<p class="intro_text">In 2009, the Maldivian government allowed locals to open their own guesthouses and restaurants 
		to tourists. Whereas before, travelers were limited to the resort islands, now they can visit and 
		stay on any local island they choose. Suddenly, homestays, hotels, and guesthouses started popping up.<br> <br>
	    Maldives is a country with nearly 1.200 large and small coral islands formed in South India, 
		in the Indian Ocean. Among them, about 200 islands are inhabited by locals. 
		This country is a collection of many very small islands quite far apart and slightly 
		fuzzy because of the relatively low altitude. The size of most islands is only 200-500m in length.</p>

  <div class="container1">
    <div class="item1">
      <img src="images/cult1.png" alt="Image 1">
      <p><b>MALDIVIAN FESTIVALS</b> <br> Since the primary religion of the Maldives is Islam, most of the festivals celebrated here 
        are Islamic festivals. The major festival of Maldives is Eid. It is revelled with pomp, and ardour throughout the country,
         like in other Islamic countries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item1">
      <img src="images/cult2.png" alt="Image 2">
      <p><b>RELIGION</b> <br>
        Islam is the official and only allowed religion in the Maldives. 
        To be a citizen or to own land, one has to be a Sunni Muslim. Historically, Maldives was a Buddhist country for a long time. 
        However, in the 12th century, a North African Arab known as Abu Al Barakat brought the first Koran to the island. 
        According to records, Maldives become an Islamic country in 1152 AD. Religion is an integral part of life here, and the 
        culture of Maldives itself is based on the Islamic Sharia law.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item1">
      <img src="images/cult3.png" alt="Image 3">
      <p><b>LANGUAGE</b> <br>
        The official language of the Maldives is called Dhivehi which is of Indo-Iranian Sanskritic origin. One can see that this language borrows from all the influence and culture of Maldives. Dhivehi is related to Sinhalese - the language of Sri Lanka - and other Indian languages, 
        although, now they're no longer mutually intelligible. The language is in the Thaana script and written from right to left like the Arab languages. </p>

      <h2>FOOD</h2>
  </div>
  <br>
<div class="destination_text">
    <p> Known for its tropical beaches and crystal-clear seas, the Maldives also have a fascinating culinary culture, sometimes called Dhivehi cuisine. <br> <br>

        Located several hundred miles from India and Sri Lanka, its nearest major landfalls, its 26 atolls lie across the equator in the Indian Ocean. Fish and seafood therefore play a key role in many of the country’s traditional dishes.
        Influenced by at least 800 years of Islam, there have been strong trade links with both Asia and Africa for centuries. This has led to a huge diversity of foods and spices used in its cuisine, while native crops like coconuts are also important.

        More recently, it has also seen some input from Britain, who governed the country as a protectorate from 1887 until independence in 1965.<br><br>

        Here are the most delicious dishes you’ll find that can be found in the Maldives.

    <div class="item2">
      <img src="images/food1.png" alt="Image 1">
      <p> <b>MAS HUNI</b> <br> common Maldives breakfast food, mas huni uses two of the primary ingredients in the country’s cuisine – tuna and coconut.

        It comprises finely chopped tuna (often from a can), together with onion and chilli peppers mixed with the flesh of a freshly-opened coconut.
        
        The coconut flesh is traditionally grated using an implement called a hunigondi, which consists of a low chair with a blade at one end over which the inner side of coconut shell halves are scrapped.<br>
        
        A variation called baraboa sees mas huni made with butternut squash instead.<br>
        
        Mas huni is normally found served with roshi, the Maldives’ version of India’s roti flatbreads, and a glass of sweet tea, the standard way to enjoy the drink on the islands.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="item2">
      <img src="images/food2.png" alt="Image 2">
      <p> <b> FIHUNU MAS </b> <br>Rather than the chopped canned tuna of mas huni, fihunu mas is a dish that focuses on a whole fish.

        A number of different species are used in the preparation of fihunu mas, with almost any medium-sized fish caught in the waters around the twenty-plus atolls used.<br>
        
        Once gutted, the fish can be scored to allow the marinade flavours to enter the fillets more easily. The marinade is thick rather than oily. It is deeply aromatic, with spices such as cumin, as well as having a spicy heat from the addition of chilli peppers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item2">
        <img src="images/food3.png" alt="Image 1">
        <p> <b> BONDA </b> <br> Bonda, or bondi in the plural, are one of the foodstuffs that demonstrate the important influence of foods from the Indian subcontinent on the cuisine of the Maldives.

            A snack food that can be considered a form of savoury doughnut, in India bonda are made with a mixture of mashed potato or vegetables. In the Maldives, it’s far more common to find bonda made with sweet potato, cassava, or taro.<br>
            
            As a result, Maldives bonda can have a sweeter profile than their Indian counterparts. Made into a batter, the ingredients are then deep-fried. Bondi are best eaten as soon as they have cooled.<br>
            
            Bondi are easy to find on the streets of Malé, the capital of the Maldives, and other towns and settlements across the islands.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item2">
        <img src="images/food4.png" alt="Image 2">
        <p> <b> ADDU BENDI</b> <br>
            Addu bendi (also spelt bondi) come from Addu Atoll, the southernmost island group that forms the Maldives. Still made on this atoll but shipped across to the other atolls in the country, addu bendi are a popular sugary snack.

The Maldives is one of the best places in the world for freediving as the water is extremely warm and quite clear—visibility of up to 100 feet or more is common. Your freediving instructor will provide the gear you need (like masks and weights), though you may want your own rash guard or long-sleeve swim shirt if you're prone to getting cold. Most scuba diving shops also offer freediving classes.</span>
